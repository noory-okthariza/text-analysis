#Note
wordcloud and wordcloud2 is two different thing
wordcloud2 is more advanced and fit for interactive output
but it doesnt automatically remove stopwords, or other words that are not 
making sense, but wordcloud can do better

wordcloud alone can handle overlap words much better than wordcloud2


# it's not really about findings or empirical
but it's about what i learn what i experience from using this text data techniqe
first, worldcloud difference
fine-tuning it's also important
